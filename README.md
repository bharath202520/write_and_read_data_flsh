Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface an Arduino with SPI-based flash memory chips, enabling operations such as reading device IDs, enabling write operations, writing data to buffers, executing programs, erasing blocks, and reading data back. The code is designed to be compatible with various Arduino boards and can be adapted for different SPI flash memory chips.

Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide a foundational understanding of how to communicate with SPI flash memory chips using an Arduino. By implementing basic operations like reading device IDs, enabling write operations, and performing read/write/erase actions, users can gain insights into the workings of non-volatile memory and its integration with microcontrollers.

Applications
Data Logging: Store sensor data or user inputs for later retrieval.

Firmware Storage: Save and retrieve firmware or configuration files.

Data Backup: Create backups of critical data to prevent loss.

Embedded Systems: Use in embedded applications requiring non-volatile storage
1. Reading Device ID
Command: 0x9F

Purpose: Identifies the manufacturer and model of the connected flash memory chip.

Usage: Ensures compatibility between the Arduino and the flash memory chip.

2. Enabling Write Operations
Command: 0x06

Purpose: Allows subsequent write operations to the flash memory.

Usage: Must be called before any write or erase operations.

3. Writing Data to Buffer
Command: 0x02

Purpose: Loads data into the flash memory buffer.

Usage: Prepares data for programming into the flash memory.

4. Executing Program
Command: 0x10

Purpose: Commits the buffered data to the flash memory.

Usage: Finalizes the write operation and makes data persistent.

5. Erasing Blocks
Command: 0xD8

Purpose: Erases a specified block of flash memory.

Usage: Frees up space for new data or removes outdated information.

6. Reading Data
Command: 0x03

Purpose: Retrieves data from the flash memory.

Usage: Verifies written data or reads stored information.
